                1 Problem - 3 languages (Coding Challenge):
              </a>
              This repository contains solutions to challenges of Advent of Code
              2020, written in 3 languages: Python, Javascript and Clojure. The
              reason for the existence of this repo is to demonstrate how my
              thinking process and coding style has significantly changed after
              moving away from object-oriented programming to functional
              programming for almost a year.

              </a>
              SeekParking is created to help users quickly find parking spaces
              in Melbourne CBD. The App consists of important features such as
              searching for available parking spaces close by a destination,
              navigating to an exact parking location, filtering of parking
              spaces based on parking time limits, setting alert for parking
              completion time, finding their car after they parked and finding
              possible available vacant car park at their arrival time. The app
              can be downloaded from Google Play. User may need to register on

                Classifying News Articles using Machine Learning (Data Science
                Project):
              </a>
              This project aims at finding a classifier that can classify news
              articles into 24 classes with best possible accuracy. The dataset
              in this project is a large set of news articles that are crawled
              from a news website. The corpus contains 133,055 news articles in
              total. 80% of news articles are randomly selected for training.
              The other 20% are used for testing, the labels of which are
              withheld.
